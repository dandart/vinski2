# Vinski II

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/danwdart/vinski2.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Long awaited sequel of the original Vinski, announced 10 years ago.
Aimed to have a Lovecraftian feel a la Quake and Oblivion

## Features
* Mouse, keyboard and PS3 controller controllable
* Renders and rotates objects
* HUD (currently static)
* Runs on modern browsers

## Intentions
* Play as and fight all of the original monsters, and more!
* More controllers
* Better HUD
* Proper collision detection
* Crazy physics
* Unexpected loopholes
* Chaos Magic
* Interactive objects
* Desktop, phone and tablet installable
* Multiplayer nonsense
* Directional audio
* Proper sound speeds
* Procedurally generated terrains
* Game saves
* Confusion of other players
* Portals
* Ninjas
* Lasers
* Shouts
* Singing Trees
* To be a learning project for me as I've always wanted to make an FPS
* For it not to become the Duke Nukem Forever of Vinski

## Warnings
There's not much about yet, I'm just making more models and scenes at the moment.
Things could be refactored and improved vastly.
