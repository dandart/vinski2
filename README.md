# Vinski II
Long awaited sequel of the original Vinski, announced 10 years ago.
Aimed to have a Lovecraftian feel a la Quake and Oblivion

## Intentions
* Play as and fight all of the original monsters, and more!
* Crazy physics
* Unexpected loopholes
* Chaos Magic
* Multiplayer nonsense
* To be a learning project for me as I've always wanted to make an FPS
* For it not to become the Duke Nukem Forever of Vinski

## Warnings
There's not much about yet, I'm just making more models and scenes at the moment.
Things could be refactored and improved vastly.
